This repo contains two files: review_scraper and summarizer. Both the files can be run using `python file_name.py`.
Regarding the review_scraper, an album url needs to be provided, this can be done by changing the url variable in the file. 
Once the data is scraped and stored in a `data` folder, you can run the summarizer file to generate a summary of the reviews.
The album name will need to be set in the summarizer.py file.
